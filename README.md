# Glenn's Code
Glenn's Code (known in the original file as GlennsCode) is a rewritten version of the VEX Joystick Controller's default code.  This rewrite allows for easier control over a robot as well as an ergonomical setup to aid with quick manuevers.  It helped me out plenty, and I think it'll help you too.

Also available as a [gist!](https://gist.github.com/simsnet/12a0683e8ded252628af13f3e70372e8)

Because this is a rewrite, the original code is property of Robomatter, developer of ROBOTC.  You are more than welcome to use this code on your robot, simply by downloading the C file or copy/pasting the code into a new project.

(A big shoutout to the retired Talon Robotics program @ Polk State College.  Without it, I wouldn't have enjoyed robotics as much as I do now.)
